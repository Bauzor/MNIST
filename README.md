## Inspiration
One of the best ways to start learning data science is to use some of the basic examples that currently exist and have lots of solutions to. MNIST is a dataset that is commonly used for those that are beginning to get into the topic of Deep Learning. Up to this point, I feel as though I have all the theoretical knowledge on convolutional neural networks and want to see if I can applied what I have learned to an actual project. So I hope you enjoy my approach to the problem based on what I currently know.

## How to run on local
I'm a windows user so this is the windows explanation on how to run the files. I will research how to get it to work for people not on windows in the future.

Must have conda installed to run

conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt

source activate <envs>
