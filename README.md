## Inspiration
One of the best ways to start learning data science is to use some of the basic examples that currently exist and have lots of solutions to. MNIST is a dataset that is commonly used for those that are beginning to get into the topic of Deep Learning. Up to this point, I feel as though I have all the theoretical knowledge on convolutional neural networks and want to see if I can applied what I have learned to an actual project. So I hope you enjoy my approach to the problem based on what I currently know.

## What it does


## How it was built


## Challenges I ran into
- Learning how to properly export a requirements.txt using either pip or conda

## What I learned


## What's next


## How to run on local
I'm on windows user so I can only tell you how to get it to work through windows.

Must have conda installed to run

conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt

source activate <envs>
